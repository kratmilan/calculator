# calculator
⚠️ This is part of TheOdinProject, that helps me learn Web Development⚠️  
  
🧮Goal of this project: Create a calculator with an interactive interface🧮  
⚡Difficulties: I could not use eval(), because it's not sade, and it made the programming way harder. (I'm not proud of the code, but it works)⚡  
📗What I've learned: how to objects in JS, create buttons, learn a bit CSS📗
